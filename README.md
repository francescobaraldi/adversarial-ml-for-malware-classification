# Adversarial ML for malware classification DNN

Project developed for the Automated Decision Making course of Master in Artificial Intelligence. It consists of adversarial machine learning attack for a DNN for malware classification. Several multilayer perceptron has been used to classify Android software in malware or bening.
## Dataset
The dataset used is [_Android malware dataset for machine learning_](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shashwatwork/android-malware-dataset-for-machine-learning?select=drebin-215-dataset-5560malware-9476-benign.csv).
It contains 215 binary features for each software and a binary label.

## Deep Neural Network
Five DNN have been used:

- DNN1: [8, 8, 8]
- DNN2: [20, 10, 8, 8]
- DNN3: [20, 20, 10, 10, 10]
- DNN4: [50, 50]
- DNN5: [100, 100]

## Adversarial examples
Specially crafted examples have been generated in order to fool the networks, the method used to create these examples is the one described by M. Fischetti and J. Jo in [_Deep Neural Network and Mixed Integer Linear Optimization_](http://www.dei.unipd.it/~fisch/papers/deep_neural_networks_and_mixed_integer_linear_optimization.pdf).
